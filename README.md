# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis Overview 

In this analysis, using unsupervised machine learning I analyze cryptocurrencies according to their features provided in a csv file. 

I complete my analysis in four steps: 

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4.  Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
